            <h3>Pharmacists who care!</h3>
            <p>Dis-Chem has been South Africa’s first choice in pharmacies since 1978, with our linked dispensaries, family clinics, wound-care clinics and comprehensive self-medication centres.
As a leading specialist in beauty, healthy food, sport supplements, health and well-being, we offer the widest ranges in these categories and expert advice.</p>
            <p>Dis-Chem was founded when recently qualified pharamacists, Ivan and Lynette Saltzman, opened their first retail pharmacy in Mondeor, south of Johannesburg, South Africa. The retail pharmacy introduced the concept of a discount pharmacy with product categories not previously offered in South African pharmacies.</p>
            <p>The Saltzman’s second retail pharmacy followed at the Randridge Mall in Randburg, north of Johannesburg. Towards the end of the 1980s, Dis-Chem began expanding its offering of non-pharmaceutical products or its “front shop” offering, and opened a third retail pharmacy. The business continued to expand in the 1990s.
Dis-Chem expanded its offering to include non-pharmaceutical/front shop products.</p>
